# Pixel-Clue
Pixel Clue is a web-based mini-game where players are challenged to guess an image as it slowly becomes clearer from a pixelated version. The quicker the player guesses, the more points they earn! Inspired by popular games like Wordle and Contexto, Pixel Clue provides an engaging, visual puzzle experience that tests playersâ€™ recognition skills.
