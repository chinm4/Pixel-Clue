Pixel Clue üéÆ
Pixel Clue is a web-based mini-game where players are challenged to guess an image as it slowly becomes clearer from a pixelated version. The quicker the player guesses, the more points they earn! Inspired by popular games like Wordle and Contexto, Pixel Clue provides an engaging, visual puzzle experience that tests players‚Äô recognition skills.

Gameplay üñºÔ∏è
Start the Game: When the game begins, you're presented with a heavily pixelated image.
Make Guesses: As time passes, the image sharpens. You can type your guess at any time. The faster you guess, the more points you earn.
Reveal & Score: If you guess correctly, you'll see your score based on your accuracy and speed. If the image fully reveals before you guess, the round ends with a reduced score.
Daily Challenge: Each day presents a unique challenge, and everyone worldwide guesses the same image.
Multiplayer: In competitive mode, guess against friends or random players in real-time to see who can identify the image first.
